# <John-Williams-Compter-Science-Portfolio>

## Description

I created a website as a portfolio in order to compile information about me and the projects that I have completed in the Rutgers Computer Science Bootcamp. Designing a website that is both appealing and functional in ordetr to give potential employers a good idea of not just what I am capable of but also that I can apply the skills that I have learned in my studies. Computer science skills are difficult to convey in just a resume or  acover letter, so a portfolio webiste is the best way to solve this issue as it involves both a list of a skills and a demonstration of those skills in the environment that they are used in. In creating this website, I gained a better understanding of using css properties for organizing a webpage and improving the appearance.

## Installation

This project requires no installation for usage rather than opening the website following the link in a browser of your choice and then using the links to navigate to further websites. The project was built using git bash and microsoft visual code.

## Usage

In order to get the full usage of the information that this website has to offer, it is imperative to use the header links to navigate through the About Me, Work, and Contact sections of this website. These are the sections that contain the information relevant to any viewers of the website that wish to get a full understanding of myself as a person and a developer. In the work section, the screenshots of the projects can be clicked on and used to traverse to separate webpages that contain the projects. After this, using the resume and linkedin hyperlinks, any viewers can leave my website and find my resume and linkedin, completing their journey through my portfolio.

## Credits

The completion of this project was aided by the efforts and assets of the rutgers computer science bootcamp. The lessons and challenges from the advanced css portion of the class served as a backbone for the construction of this project.

## License

This project was completed using the MIT license.


## Features

The Headers at the top of the page serve as links to the corresponding sections of the webpage, aside from the resume header, which links to my resume on google docs. The screenshots of the projects link to the corresponding websites for those projects, and in the contact section, the linkedin portion contains a link to my linkedin profile on an external website. These links are the features which make the website functional as a portfolio.
